# Bouncing ball
//This is a simple game where you have a timer that ticks down, and you can click the bouncing ball to add time to your timer and score points.

//How to Play
//Use the mouse to click on the bouncing ball whenever it appears on the screen.
//Each time you click the ball, your timer will be increased, and your score will go up.
//The game ends when the timer runs out.
//Technologies Used
//This game was created using HTML5 Canvas and pure JavaScript for the game logic and rendering.

//Acknowledgments
//I would like to acknowledge the following resources that helped me in creating this game:

//MDN Web Docs - 2D Breakout Game Pure JavaScript Tutorial - This guide from MDN Web Docs helped me learn how to use the HTML5 Canvas to draw and create the walls and bouncing ball in the game.

//YouTube - Click Event Listener Tutorial - This video tutorial helped me understand how to use the click event listener, which allowed me to implement the ball-clicking mechanism in the game.

//YouTube - Understanding Canvas and Drawing - This video helped me gain a better understanding of how to work with HTML5 Canvas for drawing and interacting with objects on the canvas.

//Image Credits
//I used images from Peakpx for the game. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the specific artist for the images I used.
